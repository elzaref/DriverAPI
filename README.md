# DriverAPI
I used Migration so you should use command Update-Database 
I used ADO for CRUD operation
Getall service get all Driver alphabetized 
I create a API service to create some inital data but you sould call it first
I created a function to get all driver names alphabetized
I used simple validation but there are many ways to do that like data annotation and filters
